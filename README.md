# MomentArithmetic.jl

Rigorous propagation of partial inforation about moments and dependencies in Julia.

Generalisation of First Order Error Propagation with:

- Independence between variables need not be assumed (but can be)
- Moments may be partially known (intervals)
- Input distribution assumptions no longer necessary
- Distributrional information can be obtained from moment and range information in non-linear models

This viewed as a form of *distribution-free risk analysis*.
