# MomentArithmetic.jl

Rigorous propagation of partial inforation about [moments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_(mathematics)) and [dependencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copula_(probability_theory)) in Julia.

Generalisation of First Order Error Propagation with:

- Independence between variables need not be assumed (but can be)
- Moments may be partially known (intervals)
- Input distribution assumptions no longer necessary
- Distributrional information can be obtained from moment and range information in non-linear models

May be viewed as a form of *distribution-free risk analysis*.

## Installation

Not yet a registered package, however may be installed through the Julia package manager:

```Julia
julia> ]
pkg> add https://github.com/AnderGray/MomentArithmetic.jl
```


## Features

- 9 univariate transformations: scalar multiplication, scalar translation, exp, log, ln, 1/x, x^2, sqrt and |x|
- 7 binary operations: +, -, \*, /, ^, min, max
- Independence and no dependence assumptions (Fr√©chet)
- Moments consitancy checking
- Bounding [p-box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_box) from Moments
